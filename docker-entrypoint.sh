# Previously opencode.json was baked into the image with a hardcoded model and
# a single-model provider whitelist. That meant PR_AF_MODEL was ignored by the
# opencode harness: even though the model is passed via `-m`, opencode fell back
# to (and restricted itself to) the baked model. Generating the config here from
# PR_AF_MODEL fixes that — the env var wins when set, and we fall back to the
# benchmarked default when it isn't.
set -e

# Default matches the image ENV / benchmarked model.

# opencode resolves the top-level `model` as "<provider>/<key>", and the only
# provider this config declares is `openrouter`. A bare OpenRouter slug like
# "deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-0731" therefore reads as provider "deepseek",
# which is not declared — so normalise the routing prefix in. Both forms of
# PR_AF_MODEL work as a result.
